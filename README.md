# {adamb} Package <img src="https://github.com/adambushman/adamb/blob/main/adamb_package_hex.png" align="right" width="300"/>

This package is designed by Adam B, for Adam B. The idea is to package all frequently used code into a single source for consistency and to make Adam B's life easier.

The package contains fun data sets, useful data visualization functions, and a simplified way to access personal databases.

# Getting Started

To get started with the package, install using `remotes`:

```         
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("adambushman/adamb")
```

Once installed, load the package using the `library` command below or reference individual components using the `::` framework:

```         
# Load the entire library into the session

library("adamb")

# Reference library components

adamb::office_data
```

You'll find helpful functions for data visualization, connecting to databases, and even fun, useful data sets used frequently.
